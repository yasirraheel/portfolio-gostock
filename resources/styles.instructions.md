Instructions:
1. **CSS & Styles**
   - Use only the app’s existing CSS classes and styles.  
   - Do **not** use any external CSS or JS libraries.  
   - For reference, check `account.blade.php` to see how inputs, buttons, dropdowns, and modals are styled.  
   - Avoid inline CSS — always rely on existing CSS classes.  

2. **Translations**
   - Create translation keys for all texts in the file.  
   - Review existing `lang` files to avoid duplication of keys.  

3. **Images**
   - Display images using the app’s existing URL patterns and storage methods.  
   - For reference, see how logo and profile images are handled in `account.blade.php`.  

4. **Workflow**
   - If multiple modules are being modified, complete **one module at a time**.  
   - Stop after finishing one module so it can be reviewed before moving on.
